# Go-lang-Projects
I decided to learn GO(lang) and share what I've created with it with you. 

Here it is all the code I made for the course I took on Udemy, organized by topics. 
You're free to use it for reference, embedded it into your programs or do whatever you like with it.

If you're interested in the course I took, go to the following URL:
